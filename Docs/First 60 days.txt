1) Sprint-Related Work 
    - Begin to take on sprint-related work by selecting user stories during sprint planning and working closely with a menotr for guidance
    - Focus on smaller user stories that allow for exposure to different parts of the application (e.g. fround-end changes, backend services, database operations)
    - Contribute to sprint retrospectives, offering insights or feedback from your perspective as a newer team member
    - Continue contributing to code reviews and providing constructive feedback to peers 
2) Domain Knowledge 
    - Continue to develop the breadth and depth of your knowledge of the application and domain
    - By the end of this period, aim to independently handle tasks across about 50% of the application with minimal guidance 
3) Join Deployments - Observation
    - Attend serveral deployments to understand the steps involved in deploying code to different environments (stagin, production). Ensure that the deployment that you attend provides exposure to each regular participant
    - By the end of this period, aim to be able to explain the entire deployment process, including any key tools and troubleshooting methods, to another team member
