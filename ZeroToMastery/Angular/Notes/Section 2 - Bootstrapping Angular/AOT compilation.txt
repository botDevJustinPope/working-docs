strategy for compilation
the process for code to machine code

- Is there technical debt for this in web dev? TS -> JS?

Just in time comp:
server will compile when available, browser will download the code and the server helps the browser 

Ahead-of-time comp:
server compiles everything and the browser downloads it

jit is larger vs aot is smaller 
jit the browser downloads the compiler 
jit browser catches errors 
aot server cataches errors

course uses aot compilation
