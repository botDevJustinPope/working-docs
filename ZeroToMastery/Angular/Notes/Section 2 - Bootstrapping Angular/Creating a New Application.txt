Reviewing the ng new command:

options:

--collection: this points to schematics to use in generating the intitial application
    though I do not believe we will be spinning up new angular applications all the time, this seems interesting to look into

--commit: this creates the new initial git commit for the new repository
    if created in a git repository already, what is it doing?

--creeate-application: this is the initizl application project when spinning up a new angular workspace

--experimental-zoneless: creates an application that does not utilize 'zone.js'
    what is the zone.js doing?

--inline-style: styling in the ts files
    PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS!!!!

--inline-template: html in the ts 
    PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS!!

--minimal generate a minimal angular workspace without any testing frameworks, boolean

--new-project-root: the path where new projects will be created within the workspace relative of the workspace root

--prefix: define a prefix that is applied when creating components

--skip-git: boolean to skip git

--skip-install: skip installing packages

--skip-tests: skip the generation of unit test files 

--ssr: configure the application for server-side rendering and static site generation 

--standalone: creates an application based upon the standalone api, without ngmodules, default: true

--strict: stricker type checking and bundle budgets, to help maintainability default: true 

--style: configure style for the application choices: "css", "scss", "sass", "less"

--view-encapsulation: view encapsulation mode for componets in initial project, choices: "Emulated", "None", "ShadowDom"
    what does this mean for the application?
