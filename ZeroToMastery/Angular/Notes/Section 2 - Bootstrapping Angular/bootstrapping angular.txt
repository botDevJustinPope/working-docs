we have to load up the angular code 
angular can run on a lot of platforms

components is a feature for teaching the browser for a new html element

app.component.ts is the root component of our application 

image for the console log within directory

notice that the same error "Unchecked runtime.lastError: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received"
is happening here , wonder why?

we don't pull in the appConfig right now because we don't need a router
