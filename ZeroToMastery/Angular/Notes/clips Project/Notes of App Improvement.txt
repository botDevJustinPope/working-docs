**Handling the Response **
1) Right now the messaging is a generic error, 
lets review documentation of Firebases createUserWithEmailAndPassword method 
to know the kinds of errors that are thrown back and tailor the messages to what is best.

2) UX in the register submission could better
Process:

*1 user fills out form
*2 submission is available
*3 user clicks submit

Path 4.a: invalid submission
*5 Error messaging prompting is specific to the possible errors that Firebase returns
- other reflexes of preventing resubmission unless fields are touched again and/or modified
*6 pick back up with step *3

Path 4.b: valid submission 
*6 Form should clear, and the success should either authenticate from there |or| ask them to sign in or force them to the login tab
