AC:
- in the DMH outer pererences menu create a new section to the left of the buyer's budget
- in the new section, include an appropriately sized svg such as the visualizer reset icon
- in the new section, include the user's first name 

Notes:
- App\managers\userManager.ts
    contains both the current user and the impersonated user 
- App\features\designMyHome\spendingSummary\summaryBar.html
  App\features\designMyHome\spendingSummary\summaryBar.ts 
  App\features\designMyHome\spendingSummary\summaryBar.scss 
    these files comprise of the summary bar for the story 

Ideas:
    because of the idea that the user can impersonate another user, I want to visuazlize that within the 'section'
    - Icon: 
        utilze the followwing icons
        user - https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/person-fill/
        impersonated - https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/person-video/
        these will be added to the wwwroot\Content\icons\icons.svg
    - user name section 
        create a new component to encapsulate the logic for the user name
