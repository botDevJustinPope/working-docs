Design/changes:
- Discovery:
    The menu is built based on the routes that are configured in the app
    app.ts is where the router is configured 
    main-menu.ts/main-menu.html is where the 'component' is configured and displayed
    tilePatternReports / (.ts .html .scss) is the component that will be duplicated

- changes:
    add a new route Tile Patterns 2 based on Tile Patterns report (app.ts)
    modify the tilePatternReports to have the title be able to be configured to be passed in
    - default title to have the original title 
    - new route to have "Tile Pattern Reports 2"
