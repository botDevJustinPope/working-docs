ONBOARDING: Create a new view in VDS - User Info
Create a new view called User Info. This includes the menu and routing to navigate to the view.

AC:
    - Create a new view called User Info, and display the following information:
        First Name
        Last Name 
        Email
        Welcome Email Sent
        Welcome Email Validated
        Is Test User
    - Create a new navigation menu item called My Info under the User / Session category and route to the new view that you've created

Thoughts:
    - editUserProfile view 
        editUserProfile.html
        editUserProfile.ts 
        editUserProfile.scss

    the ditUserProfile feature/view contains all the fields that are needed for this story

Extra:
    - create a pencil button to go to the edit view 
    - profile picture?
        ** there is going to be a lot of Architecture for this **
        but I think the code is there to pick from
