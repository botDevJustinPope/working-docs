AC:
- Create a value converter that will accept the numeric rounding value for an Organiztion and return the appropriate string that we'd like to see on the site
- Apply the value converter to the Organiztion Details view
- Remove any code that has been rendered obsolete due to this change 

Notes:
- in veo admin src/value-converter is where where the value converters are 
- and src/index.ts is where the configure for the value converts are 

Code edits:
- add src/resuorces/value-converters/roundingLable.ts
- add the converter to the src/index.ts 
- updates to src/models/Organiztion.ts
    looking into the Domain BuildOnTechnologies.VDS.Domain/Organiztion/OrganizationDetailDTO.cs, the property RoutingType is just an int
    because of this:
    - line 26 | roundingType property can be just a number
    - line 48 | method roundingTypeLabel() is obsolete
    - line 60 | roundingTypes Array<IRoundingTypes> : either moved or obsolete
    - line 109 | interface IRoundingTypes obsolete?
    - line 114 | enum OrganizationRoundingTypes can be moved to the converter or obsolete 

- views:
    - organizationDetails.html - line 41 utilize converter
    - createOrganization.html - line 45 utilize converter 
    *** this would be the reason not to remove the definitions for the routing types ***
    *** Idea: move the enum out to its own file to seperate it from the Organiation.ts model ***
