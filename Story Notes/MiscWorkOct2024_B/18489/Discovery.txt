Design for video links 

    links would need to be able to be added to a sql table and then fetched from the site when the componenet needs it

    1) SQL 
        new table for storing the url to be used in the application

        Table name: VideoCategory
        Description: list of named categories that is going to be used to define the video link 
        Columns : 
        ID - unique identification
        CategoryName - name for the category 

        Table name: VideoURL
        columns:
        ID - unique identification
        Category - foregien key to VideoCategory table 
        URL - string of the url for the video 

    2) API endpoints for video maintenance

        get VideoCategories - fetch list of VideoCategory and VideoURL records

        get VideoURL by CategoryName - fetch video url by VideoCategory.CategoryName
        post VideoURL - inserts VideoURL record 
        put VideoURL - updates VideoURL record 

    3) VDS implementation 

        service wrapping around endpoint
        each static url link converted to fetch url from endpoint 

    4) VDS Admin front end 

        Admin page to maintain videos 
        Similar to an Organizations video update productPerformanceCare.ts
