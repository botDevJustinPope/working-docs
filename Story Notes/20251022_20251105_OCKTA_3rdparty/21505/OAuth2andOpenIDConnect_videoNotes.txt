Notes on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:

Thoughts on better Authentication just for VDS:
**Delegated authorization**
How can i let a website access my data (without giving it my password)?
This is done with the page that something like Google prompts that some site is accessing your information from Google.

Pre OAuth flow, Yelp tried to solve this by requesting your authentication with Google to do what they needed and then "throw it away"
I tried to suggest that we could do this to Daniel, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

OAuth basic flow:
1) site redirects to authentication provider
2) user authenticates with provider
3) provider sends user back to a call back to the site 
4) site trusts provider and authenticates user

OAuth 2.0:
Resource owner: the user 
Client: the application / site 
authorization server: the system to say "yes" example access users google information
Resource server: api / system that the client is trying to access example: google contacts
authorization grant:
Redirect URI: where to end up after authentication
Access Token:
scope:
content:

Setting up a client?
- for VDS we would want to have some sort of configuration to set up 3rd party authentication servers
- this would be needed for secrets

OpenID Connect adds the following:
- Id Token
