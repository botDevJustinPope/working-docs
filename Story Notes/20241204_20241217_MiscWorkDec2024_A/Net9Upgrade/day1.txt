    - .HasDatabaseName - what? why that
    Explanation: This line is part of the configuration for an index on the AareasSceneSurface entity.
                 Specifically, it sets the name of the index in the database to 
                 "UX_AareasSceneConfiguration_VisualizationProviderId_SceneId_SurfaceName".
