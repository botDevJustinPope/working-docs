Thoughts:
- What are we wanting to accomplish?
    Before end of this sprint:
        Tentative curriculumn and roadmap for both framework and tooling 
- Roadmap:
    Is the tentative time line for the accomplishing the training the following:
        - 50% sprint work for 2 months (4 sprints | 120 ~ 160 hours of training)
            calc : (3~4 hour days) * (5 day work week) * ( 8 weeks = 4 sprints )
            calc : (2 hours days)

        - tentative 20% sprint work for 4ish months to have a slow burn

        Starting with Angular Zero to Mastery
            course states 29.5 hours and devs take 40 days to complete
            estimate 60~80 road map hours
